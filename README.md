# Fiddler.UrlReplace

Fiddler bulk URL extends Fiddlers existing UrlReplace command with a few new features like multiple search/replace items, UI, load and save commands, extended command line interface plus a few other tricks.

[Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/support/fiddler)’s UrlReplace lets you change URL’s on the fly transparent to most browser and many other programs using the net. This plugin extends this functionality in the following arrears.

* **Multiple replaces**: Allows you to specify a set of search/replace parameters and specify the order in which they should execute
* **[Command line interface](Documentation/CommandLineInterface.md.md)**: Extends the existing Command line interface with new commands while respecting the [existing functionality](https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/knowledgebase/quickexec)
* **Extended options** : Lets you specify in more details how the search/replace should behave

You can also use this plugin for settingup Fiddler for [debugging localhost traffic](Documentation/debugging-localhost-traffic.md) and [webservices](Documentation/Webservices.md)
