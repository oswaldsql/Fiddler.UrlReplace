# Fiddler.UrlReplace

Fiddler bulk URL extends Fiddlers existing UrlReplace command with a few new features like multiple search/replace items, UI, load and save commands, extended command line interface plus a few other tricks.

[Fiddler2](http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/)’s UrlReplace lets you change URL’s on the fly transparent to most browser and many other programs using the net. This plugin extends this functionality in the following arrears.

* **Multiple replaces**: Allows you to specify a set of search/replace parameters and specify the order in which they should execute
* **Persistence** : Saves your settings from session to session
* **Load/Save** : Lets you load and save settings file for sharing
* **[UI](Documentation/UI.md)** : Presents a UI for creating and maintaining search/replace items
* **[Command line interface](Documentation/Command-line-interface.md)**: Extends the existing Command line interface with new commands while respecting the [existing functionality](http://www.fiddler2.com/Fiddler/help/quickexec.asp)
* **Extended options** : Lets you specify in more details how the search/replace should behave
