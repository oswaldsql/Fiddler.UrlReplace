# Project Description

Fiddler bulk URL extends Fiddler2’s existing UrlReplace command with a few new features like multiple search/replace items, UI, load and save commands, extended command line interface and a few other tricks.

[Fiddler2](https://www.telerik.com/support/fiddler)’s UrlReplace lets you change URL’s on the fly transparent to most browser and many other programs using the net. This plugin extends this functionality in the following arrears.
* **Multiple replaces**: Allows you to specify a set of search/replace parameters and specify the order in which they should execute
* **Persistence** : Saves your settings from session to session
* **Load/Save** : Lets you load and save settings file for sharing
* **[UI](UI)** : Presents a UI for creating and maintaining search/replace items
* **[Command line interface](CommandLineInterface)**: Extends the existing Comman line interface with new commands while respecting the [existing functionality](https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/knowledgebase/quickexec)
* **Extended options** : Lets you specify in more details how the search/replace should behave
